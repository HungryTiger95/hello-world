# hello-world
First repository on GitHub.

Hello everyone! My name is Mayuresh Patel and I consider myself an amateur coder.
My overall goal is to land a job and become a software or web developer by profession.
I plan on having projects and practice exercises updated on this website regularly, so
feel free to check everything out and give me tips on how to improve. I would also love
to hear about "good coding practices" be it personal preferances or industry-wide views.
